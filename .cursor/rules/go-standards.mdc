For Go code:
- Follow Go's standard naming conventions: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for exported functions
- Respect Go's error handling patterns by returning errors rather than using exceptions
- Keep functions small and focused with single responsibility
- Organize functions within packages based on related functionality
- Use context.Context as the first parameter for API calls and long-running operations
- Prefer composition over inheritance when designing interfaces
- Use meaningful variable names, not single letters (except in simple loops)
